## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


```{r}
install.packages("stringr")
library(stringr)
```

Matrix, Arrays, and Vector Practice

```{r}
m <- matrix(data=c(1,2,3,4,5,6),nrow=2,ncol=3,byrow=TRUE)
m


v1 <- c(1,2,3,4)
v2 <- c(6,7,8,9)
m1 <- rbind(v1,v2)
m1


m2 <- cbind(v1,v2)
m2

v <- 101:200
v[seq(from = 1, to = 50, by = 2)]


```



Now let's try these Challenges

```{r}

v1<-c("Stately,","plump","Buck","Mulligan","came","from","the","stairhead,","bearing","a","bowl","of","lather","on","which","a","mirror","and","a","razor","lay","crossed.")
